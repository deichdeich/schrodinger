# schrodinger

This is the repo for my schrodinger.py code.  I wrote it to get a handle on the matplotlib.animate function.  The code will time evolve a gaussian wavefunction in any 1-D analytic potential you set.

The code is adapted from Jake Vanderplas' excellent tutorial at https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/
